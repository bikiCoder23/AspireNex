# AspireNex
This repository represents tasks that were assigned for the internship oppurtunity in AspireNex.

## Domain Selected
For this wonderful oppurtunity, I have chosen the domain of Data Science since the task under this domain were quite interesting as well as challenging and the Domain of Data Science has always remained as a special field of interest for me.

## Task Selected

### TASK 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
- Used a Sequential model under keras library to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
- Used a variety of preprocessing techniques such as feature selection, imputing missing values and converting categorical values to numerical.
- Training the model over the train_data for 50 epochs with accuracy as the metric for evaluation.
- Checking whether the model gets overfitted or not by comparing loss with validation_loss.
- The model hence created has a prediction acurracy of 100% with other parameters like precision and recall close to or equal to 100%.
### Dataset
Titanic Survival Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/titanic-datasets)

### TASK 5 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
- Used a Sequential model under keras library and created a Shallow Neural Network to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
- Using Undersampling technique, the data was first balanced having equal number of fraudulent or genuine transactions.
- Data is preprocessed for scaling and normalising certain key features like Amount and Time.
- Training the model over the train_data for 50 epochs with accuracy as the metric for evaluation.
- The model hence created has a prediction acurracy of 93% with other parameters like precision and recall 94% and 95% respectively.
